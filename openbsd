[Installing packages]

# Install packages from source via ports
  pkg_add i3-gaps i3lock i3status

# Enable & start xenodm
  rcctl enable <service name> && rcctl start <service name>


[PACKAGE MANAGEMENT]
* Documentation: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/ports.html

# Searching for package
  cd /usr/ports
  make search key=[package name]

# Searching for different versions offered for the same package
  cd /usr/ports/[package]/[sub-package]
  make show=FLAVORS

# Installing with a particular flavor
  cd /etc/ports/[package]/[sub-package]
  env FLAVOR="[insert_flavor]" make install 

# Showing sub packages
  make show=MULTI_PACKAGES

# To list the different packages built by a port, 
  make show=PKGNAMES

# Installing sub package
  env SUBPACKAGE="-name" make install

# Cleaning after install 
  make clean (only cleans built package)
  make clean=depends ( does(1) + also cleans depends)
  make package BULK=Yes (to automatically cleanup after install)

# Removing package
  cd /usr/ports/[package]/[sub-package]
  make uninstall 

# Embedded devices without hardware clock
  * Usually ntpd should be enabled using rcctl since most embedded do not have a hardware clock.

    If the time is inaccurate, you can:
        > Set the correct location first:
           'ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/[Country] /etc/localtime'
        > Sync network time:  
	   'ntpd -vs' / 'rdate -v pool.ntp.org'
